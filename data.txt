Frame semantics is a linguistic theory that has been instantiated for English in the FrameNet lexicon. We solve the problem of frame-semantic parsing using a two-stage statistical model that takes lexical targets (i.e., content words and phrases) in their sentential contexts and predicts frame-semantic structures. Given a target in context, the first stage disambiguates it to a semantic frame. This model uses latent variables and semi-supervised learning to improve frame disambiguation for targets unseen at training time. The second stage finds the target's locally expressed semantic arguments. At inference time, a fast exact dual decomposition algorithm collectively predicts all the arguments of a frame at once in order to respect declaratively stated linguistic constraints, resulting in qualitatively better structures than naïve local predictors. Both components are feature-based and discriminatively trained on a small set of annotated frame-semantic parses. On the SemEval 2007 benchmark data set, the approach, along with a heuristic identifier of frame-evoking targets, outperforms the prior state of the art by significant margins. Additionally, we present experiments on the much larger FrameNet 1.5 data set. We have released our frame-semantic parser as open-source software.
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems automatically choose the intended meaning of a word in context. In this article we present a WSD algorithm based on random walks over large Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKB). We show that our algorithm performs better than other graph-based methods when run on a graph built from WordNet and eXtended WordNet. Our algorithm and LKB combination compares favorably to other knowledge-based approaches in the literature that use similar knowledge on a variety of English data sets and a data set on Spanish. We include a detailed analysis of the factors that affect the algorithm. The algorithm and the LKBs used are publicly available, and the results easily reproducible.
Finding the right representations for words is critical for building accurate NLP systems when domain-specific labeled data for the task is scarce. This article investigates novel techniques for extracting features from n-gram models, Hidden Markov Models, and other statistical language models, including a novel Partial Lattice Markov Random Field model. Experiments on part-of-speech tagging and information extraction, among other tasks, indicate that features taken from statistical language models, in combination with more traditional features, outperform traditional representations alone, and that graphical model representations outperform n-gram models, especially on sparse and polysemous words.
What is here called controlled natural language (CNL) has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.
The written form of the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs in a non-trivial manner from the various spoken regional dialects of Arabic—the true “native languages” of Arabic speakers. Those dialects, in turn, differ quite a bit from each other. However, due to MSA's prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content. In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic On-line Commentary Data set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors (like over-identification of one's own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence, determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using dialectal data significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA-only data, achieving near-human classification accuracy. Finally, we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on-line Arabic newspapers.
